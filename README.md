# Vehicle Safety System: Drowsiness Detection <br>
This repository contains a project focused on enhancing vehicle safety through the implementation of a driver drowsiness detection system. The system actively tracks and analyzes the driver’s face and eye movements in real-time, enabling the calculation of a drowsiness index to enhance accident prevention.

## Key Features <br >
**Real-Time Tracking:** The system actively tracks and analyzes the driver’s face and eye movements in real time. <br >
**Drowsiness Index:** The system calculates a drowsiness index based on the driver’s eye movements, which can be used to alert the driver or take necessary actions to prevent accidents.<br >
**Implemented in Matlab:** The system is implemented in Matlab, demonstrating its capabilities in handling real-time image processing tasks.<br > <br >
**##Algorithms Used** <br>
**Sobel Edge Detection:** Used for detecting the edges of the driver’s face and eyes.<br >
**Viola-Jones Algorithm:** Used for real-time face detection.<br >
**K-Means Clustering:** Used for identifying whether the driver’s eyes and mouth are open or closed.<br><br>
This project demonstrates how image processing algorithms can enhance vehicle safety by preventing accidents caused by driver drowsiness.

Authors of this Project are Krishna Sai, Ajith Chowdary, and Mohith Kumar.<br >
