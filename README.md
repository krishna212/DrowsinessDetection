# DrowsinessDetection

The project works as a Vehicle Safety- system. The aim of this system is to locate, track, and analyze both the driver's face and eyes to compute a drowsiness index to prevent accidents.
It is implemented in MATLAB & the algorithms used are “Sobel- Edge Detection”,” Viola-Jones Algorithm” & “K-Means Clustering”. We used K-Means to identify the eyes & mouth as closed (or) open.
